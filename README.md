Written by [@Arthur-Viegas-Eguia](https://.com/Arthur-Viegas-Eguia) and [@artemyushko](https://github.com/artemyushko) for Dave Musicant's "CS-251 Programming Languages: Design and Implementation" class taught in Carleton College.
This scheme compiler implements frames, procedures, among many other features of scheme. 

To compile the interpreter, run `just build` in your command line, and then type `./interpreter < YOUR_FILE` to execute it.
